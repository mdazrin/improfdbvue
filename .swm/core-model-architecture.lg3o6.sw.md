# Overview

Core Model is a rename of old User Model. The first User Model contain duplicate 'name' fields, as it needs a 'name' field for session and 'firstname and lastname' for table. It was bad idea for a Model, so we redesign it back to function for table only, also change its name to more conventional name, Core Model.

## Migration

Migration file helps developer to design database in simpler way. The file located at `ðŸ“„ database/migrations/2023_03_06_221638_create_cores_table.php`

## Factory

Factory helps seeding table with dummy data. The file located at `ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php`

<br/>

Inside the class, we declare which model is associated with this factory class
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php
```hack
11     class CoreFactory extends Factory
12     {
13         protected $model = Core::class;
```

<br/>

Then, we use faker helper functions to generate dummy data. We can seed the model using tinker in terminal
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php
```hack
19         public function definition(): array
20         {
21             return [
22                 'first_name' => fake()->firstName(),
23                 'last_name' => fake()->lastName(),
24                 'ppi' => fake()->numberBetween([1],[100]),
25                 'batch' => fake()->firstName(),
26     
27             ];
28         }
```

<br/>

# Model

The model is located at `ðŸ“„ app/Models/Core.php`. It is the Eloquent ORM of Cores table.

# Controller

The controller is where the application logic is written. The file is located at `ðŸ“„ app/Http/Controllers/CoreController.php`

<br/>

Since we are using Inertia, we need to import these two packages
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ app/Http/Controllers/CoreController.php
```hack
7      use Inertia\Inertia;
8      use Inertia\Response;
```

<br/>

## Index

<br/>

Index function is called to view the Model objects

Line 17<br/>
We assign cores as Core Model objects

Line 18-19<br/>
return the data at Welcome component page with parameter Core objects
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ app/Http/Controllers/CoreController.php
```hack
15         public function index(): Response
16         {
17             $cores = Core::all();
18             return Inertia::render('Welcome',[
19                 'cores'=>$cores,
20             ]);
21         }
```

<br/>

# Route

<br/>

We use get requests at '/' url and use CoreController class with index method
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ routes/web.php
```hack
19     Route::get('/',[CoreController::class,'index']);
```
