# Overview

Core Model is a rename of old User Model. The first User Model contain duplicate 'name' fields, as it needs a 'name' field for session and 'firstname and lastname' for table. It was bad idea for a Model, so we redesign it back to function for table only, also change its name to more conventional name, Core Model.

# Migration

Migration file helps developer to design database in simpler way. The file located at `ðŸ“„ database/migrations/2023_03_06_221638_create_cores_table.php`

# Factory

Factory helps seeding table with dummy data. The file located at `ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php`

Inside the class, we declare which model is associated with this factory class

### ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php
```hack
11     class CoreFactory extends Factory
12     {
13         protected $model = Core::class;
```

<br/>

Then, we use faker helper functions to generate dummy data. We can seed the model using tinker in terminal
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ database/factories/CoreFactory.php
```hack
19         public function definition(): array
20         {
21             return [
22                 'first_name' => fake()->firstName(),
23                 'last_name' => fake()->lastName(),
24                 'ppi' => fake()->numberBetween([1],[100]),
25                 'batch' => fake()->firstName(),
26     
27             ];
28         }
```
