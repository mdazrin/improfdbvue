# Overview

This documentation is about explaining how Vue works in our system. We choose Vue and Tailwind as front-end frameworks. We also select Single Page Application techniques by combining the front end with Inertia.

# Entry Point

The entry point of app is `ðŸ“„ resources/js/app.js`. This is where we mount our application.

# Main Page

The main page is `ðŸ“„ resources/js/Pages/Welcome.vue`. From here, we use main layout, before breaking it to smaller layouts. This is the explanation of how the code works

<br/>

Line 2<br/>
We import Head using Inertia as default Inertia syntax can only pass body, to pass head meta, we need this setup

Line 3<br/>
To use default layout, we need to import Layout

Line 5<br/>
This is the plugin if we want to use persistent Layout

Line 7<br/>
We define properties here before passing it down to template below

### ðŸ“„ resources/js/Pages/Welcome.vue
```vue
1      <script setup>
2      import {Head} from "@inertiajs/vue3";
3      import Layout from '@/Layouts/Layout.vue'
4      
5      defineOptions({ layout: Layout })
6      defineProps({
